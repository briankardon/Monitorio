# Monitorio

Hardware + software for sub-frame-accurate synchronization between a
displayed video and an external recording, using on-screen photodiode
sync tags.

The video tagging script overlays a small array of black/white "bit
circles" onto each frame of a video; the bits encode the frame number
in reflected-binary [Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code).
A small PCB of photodiodes (Monitorio) is mounted on the display so
each photodiode covers one bit position. The photodiodes' analog
outputs go into an NI-DAQmx data acquisition card, which records them
alongside whatever else the experiment is sampling. Decoding that DAQ
trace recovers, for each DAQ sample, which video frame was on screen
at that moment.

You only need the Monitorio PCB if you want a turnkey assembly.
**The software side works with any photodiode + amplifier hardware**
that produces an analog voltage proportional to local screen
illumination, fast enough to settle within one video frame. A breadboard
build with discrete photodiodes and a single quad op-amp is sufficient;
the calibration tool will locate them automatically wherever you stick
them on the screen.

## Hardware

The Monitorio PCB (see `Hardware/Monitorio_v1.1/`) carries four surface-
mount photodiodes (`D1`-`D4`), an OPA4323 quad op-amp configured as four
transimpedance amplifiers, and an RJ45 output jack. Each PD's amplified
voltage is one channel; the cable carries all four plus ground/shield to
a breakout into the DAQ. Run on a single 5 V supply, so signals are
0-5 V (typically ~50% dynamic range with the default photodiode
sensitivity and gain).

Pieces of the PCB design files:

- `*.kicad_sch`, `*.kicad_pcb` -- KiCad schematic and board.
- `CAM/` -- Gerbers and drill file for fab.
- `Photodiode Amplifier Reference Circuit.pdf` -- the TI app note the
  TIA topology is taken from.

The software does not know or care about the PCB. Channel layout is
detected from photodiode response during calibration, and any other
analog source that meets the requirements below can be substituted.

### What other photodiode hardware needs to do

If you're not using the Monitorio PCB, your replacement must:

1. Output an analog voltage that increases monotonically with light
   level on each photodiode, with at least a few hundred mV of dynamic
   range between black and white screen.
2. Settle within one video frame interval (a TIA bandwidth of ~1 kHz is
   plenty for 60 Hz video; the calibration procedure measures actual
   rise time and reports it).
3. Plug into an NI-DAQmx-compatible analog input device for
   calibration (the calibration script uses NI-DAQmx directly). The
   actual experimental recording can use any DAQ/ephys hardware
   that produces a numpy array; the decoder is unit-agnostic with
   the right `scale` argument. Channels for calibration can be
   single-ended (RSE/NRSE) or differential (DIFF/PSEUDO_DIFF); the
   calibration script accepts a `--terminal-config` flag. A loader
   for Intan RHD recordings is included
   (`Source/loaders/rhd.py`); other formats are bring-your-own.


## Software requirements

Driver and OS-level tools (install separately, **not** via pip):

- **NI-DAQmx driver** -- vendor download from National Instruments,
  required for `nidaqmx` to talk to any DAQ device. Windows builds are
  the most-tested target; Linux builds are also available from NI.
- **ffmpeg** (and `ffprobe`) -- must be on `PATH`. The video tagging
  script shells out to ffmpeg for decoding/encoding; the decoder uses
  ffprobe to read fps and frame count from the tagged video; the
  playback script also probes videos with ffprobe.
- **VLC media player** (https://www.videolan.org/) -- required only
  for the random-playback session driver
  (`Source/playback/play_random.py`). The `python-vlc` Python package
  is just the bindings; the actual VLC binary needs to be installed
  separately. Skip this if you don't use the playback driver. Note
  that the VLC folder that contains libvlc.dll (typically the same
  one that contains vlc.exe) must be on the system path, and the
  bitness of VLC (32 vs 64) must match the bitness of python
  (probably 64 bit).
- **Python 3.12+** -- developed against 3.14. Any 3.12+ should work.

Python packages (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside
a virtualenv):

- `pygame-ce>=2.5` -- fullscreen rendering for calibration patterns
  and the random-playback driver.
- `numpy>=1.26`
- `nidaqmx>=1.0` -- requires the NI driver above; only used by
  calibration.
- `matplotlib>=3.8` -- inspection plots that pop up at the end of
  calibration; harmless if unused elsewhere.
- `python-vlc>=3.0` -- bindings for the random-playback driver.
  Skip / uninstall if you don't run `play_random.py`.

For running the test suite, also: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
(currently just `pytest`).

```

1. **Calibrate** the rig once after physically mounting the PD board.
   This locates each photodiode on the screen, picks bit-circle and
   background-circle radii, measures monitor rise/fall time and
   channel crosstalk, and writes everything to a JSON file.
2. **Tag** each video you'll display: a new copy with Gray-coded bit
   circles overlaid at the calibrated screen-pixel positions, plus
   leading guard frames (default 5) that absorb the first-frame
   skips most video players do at startup.
3. **Display** the tagged video on the calibrated rig and **record**
   the photodiode channels on the DAQ alongside whatever else the
   experiment is sampling. `Source/playback/play_random.py` automates
   the display side (random video selection + exponential inter-video
   gaps) for animal-experiment workflows.
4. **Decode** the DAQ trace with `Source/decode_sync_tags.py`: pass
   in the recorded `(n_channels, n_samples)` numpy array, the tagged
   video path, and the calibration JSON. Get back a table of
   `(frame_number, sample_index)` rows. The decoder reads the
   tagger's `<output_video>.tags.json` sidecar automatically for the
   sync-bit setting and channel-to-bit assignment. A loader for
   Intan RHD recordings is included in `Source/loaders/rhd.py`;
   other formats: load samples however you like.
5. **Use** the resulting frame-number-per-sample mapping for the
   actual analysis -- correlate neural events with what was on
   screen, look up frame content in the *original* (untagged) video,
   etc.


## Quick start

```bash
# One-off, after wiring up the PD board and pointing it at the display.
# Runs the full calibration interactively (instruction screens + plots,
# asks before saving). Output: calibration_<timestamp>.json
venv/Scripts/python Source/calibration/scripts/calibrate.py

# Tag a video against an existing calibration JSON.

    --calibration-file calibration_20260417-162539.json

# Or do both in one step (calibrates first, then tags using its JSON):
venv/Scripts/python Source/add_video_sync_tags.py \
    in.mp4 out.mp4 --calibrate

# Manual override -- skip calibration entirely if you have known
# good positions for the rig:
venv/Scripts/python Source/add_video_sync_tags.py \
    in.mp4 out.mp4 \
    --bit-xs 75,140,205,270 --bit-ys 1850 \
    --bit-radius 15 --background-radius 25

# Run a random-playback session (drives the rig during recording):
venv/Scripts/python Source/playback/play_random.py CONFIG.toml
# (See Source/playback/example_config.toml for the config format.)
```

After recording, decode in Python:

```python
from decode_sync_tags import decode_sync_tags
from loaders.rhd import load_rhd_board_adc   # Intan; or roll your own loader

bundle = load_rhd_board_adc(["recording.rhd", "recording_2.rhd"])
result = decode_sync_tags(
    bundle.samples[2:5],         # the 3 channels carrying the PD signals
    sample_rate=bundle.sample_rate,
    video_path="exp01_tagged.mp4",
    calibration_path="cal.json",
    output_path="frame_table.csv",
)
# result.frame_table[:, 0] = frame numbers; result.frame_table[:, 1] = sample indices
```


## `calibrate.py` reference

Runs all of the following, in order, and writes the result to a single
JSON file:

1. Baseline characterization -- per-channel noise floor (black screen)
   and full-scale response (white screen). Channels whose dynamic
   range doesn't exceed the noise floor by 10x are flagged as "dead"
   and skipped for the rest of the calibration.
2. Coarse structured-light localization -- displays Gray-coded stripe
   patterns at successively finer bit widths along each axis. Each PD
   reads its own position one bit per pattern; the result locates each
   PD to within 32 px on each axis. ~1 minute on a typical rig.
3. Fine bar-sweep refinement -- a thin bar marches across each PD's
   coarse window; a noise-rejected weighted centroid pinpoints the PD's
   center to sub-pixel precision and records its FWHM (used as a
   diameter estimate).
4. Bit-circle radius selection per PD -- sized from FWHM to saturate
   the PD without encroaching on neighbors.
5. Background-circle radius selection per PD -- sized from the bar-
   sweep tails so the PD doesn't see past the edge of its black
   background when the bit is off.
6. Rise/fall-time measurement -- single-channel high-rate capture of
   black-to-white and white-to-black transitions on each PD. Useful as
   a per-rig sanity check (LCDs are slow, OLEDs are fast).
7. Crosstalk verification -- light each PD's chosen bit circle in turn
   and read every channel; reports the worst off-diagonal leak.

After all measurements complete, three matplotlib figures pop up
(spatial response, temporal response, crosstalk heatmap) for visual
sanity check. The script then asks whether to save the JSON.

The JSON contains: monitor index/resolution, DAQ device + product type
+ terminal config + sample rate, and per-PD `(x_px, y_px, bit_radius_px,
background_radius_px, baseline_dark_v, baseline_bright_v,
dynamic_range_v, rise_duration_s, fall_duration_s, ...)`. Plus the full
crosstalk matrix.

Common flags:

- `--display N` -- pick which monitor (default 0).
- `--device NAME` -- pick which DAQ device, e.g. `Dev1`.
- `--terminal-config {RSE,DIFF,NRSE,PSEUDO_DIFF}` -- AI terminal
  configuration. RSE is the default. In DIFF/PSEUDO_DIFF the script
  automatically restricts itself to the half of physical channels that
  the device exposes as differential positive inputs.
- `--cache PATH` -- cache the slow baselines + coarse + fine
  measurements (~1 min) so a re-run picks up where the last left off.
  Default is `calibration_cache.npz` in CWD. Pass `--force` to ignore
  any existing cache.
- `--no-plot`, `--no-confirm` -- non-interactive batch mode.
- `--crosstalk-threshold PCT` -- pass/fail threshold (default 5%).


## `add_video_sync_tags.py` reference

Reads `video_in`, writes `video_out` with a Gray-coded sync-tag overlay
at every frame. Audio (if present) is copied through unchanged.

Parameter resolution order (per parameter, top wins):

1. Value passed explicitly on the CLI (`--bit-xs`, `--bit-radius`, etc.)
2. Calibration JSON (`--calibration-file` or `--calibrate`).
3. Error -- there is no "default" because sensible values depend on
   the specific rig.

Frame numbers are 1-indexed. With sync-bit mode (the default,
`--sync-bit`), the first PD is reserved as an always-on indicator
and the remaining N-1 PDs carry an N-1-bit Gray-coded frame counter
that cycles every `2**(N-1)` frames. The Gray code preserves the
single-bit-change-per-step property across the wrap edge; the
decoder disambiguates which cycle each sample belongs to using sample
timing and frame-rate info from the tagged video. With `--no-sync-bit`,
all N PDs carry the counter (cycle `2**N`), but frames at every
multiple of the cycle Gray-encode to all-bits-off, which is
indistinguishable from "video off" in the recording -- so the
default `--sync-bit` is recommended unless you really need the extra
bit of cycle length.

Selected flags:

- `--calibration-file PATH` -- use a saved calibration JSON.
- `--calibrate` -- run `calibrate.py` first and use its output, all in
  one command. Forwards `--display`, `--device`, `--cache`, `--force`,
  `--terminal-config` to the subprocess.
- `--bit-xs A,B,C`, `--bit-ys A,B,C`, `--bit-radius N`,
  `--background-radius N` -- manual overrides for any of the calibrated
  values. All are in **screen pixel coords** (the same coord system the
  calibration JSON uses), not video-frame coords.
- `--leading-guard-frames N` -- prepend N untagged black frames to the
  output (default 5). Most video players silently skip 1–3 frames at
  the start of playback; the guards absorb those skips so real source
  frames still play cleanly. Guards have sync OFF, so the decoder's
  segment detection ignores them entirely -- decoded frame N maps
  directly to source video frame N regardless of how many guards the
  player consumed (up to N). Set to 0 to disable.
- `--sync-bit` / `--no-sync-bit` -- whether to reserve the first PD as
  an always-on "video active" indicator. **Enabled by default.** When
  on, PD index 0 in the calibration JSON (= the lowest-numbered live
  AI channel, by physical pin order) is lit on every video frame, and
  the remaining n-1 PDs Gray-encode the frame number. This lets the
  decoder cleanly distinguish "video off" (sync dark) from any frame
  state (sync lit) -- without it, frame numbers at every multiple of
  2**n_bits encode to all-dark and look identical to "off." Cost: the
  cycle drops by 2x (16 -> 8 with 4 PDs), so the decoder has to
  disambiguate cycles from timing more often. The script prints the
  sync/frame-bit channel assignment at startup so a decoder author can
  confirm it.
- `--pad-for-unambiguous-end` / `--no-pad-for-unambiguous-end` --
  only relevant in `--no-sync-bit` mode. If the input video's frame
  count is an exact multiple of the cycle length, the very last
  frame Gray-encodes to all-zeros and would be indistinguishable from
  "video off." With this flag (default on), the tagger appends a
  single extra black-content frame so the final tag pattern is
  unambiguous. No-op in sync-bit mode (the issue can't arise there).
- `--screen-size WxH` -- screen pixel dimensions of the display the PD
  board is mounted on, e.g. `2400x1600`. Required unless
  `--calibration-file` is given (then read from the JSON's
  `monitor.width/height`). The output video is rendered at whatever size
  preserves the screen aspect ratio with **minimal padding** around the
  input (no upscaling, no cropping); tag positions and radii are scaled
  by `output_w / screen_w` so they land at the correct screen pixels
  when the output is shown full-screen on this display. The script
  errors out if the input is larger than the screen in either dimension
  (cropping would lose content), and warns if the scaled tag radius
  drops below ~3 px (likely too small to read reliably -- use a larger
  input video).
- `--codec NAME` -- ffmpeg encoder. Defaults to `libx264` (CPU; always
  works). On a machine with an NVIDIA GPU and an ffmpeg build linked
  against the NVIDIA SDK, `--codec h264_nvenc` (or `hevc_nvenc`) is
  typically 5-10x faster. The script does a build-level check at
  startup and errors out if the encoder isn't compiled in; runtime
  failures (e.g. ffmpeg has the encoder but the GPU isn't supported)
  surface as an ffmpeg error during the encode -- if that happens,
  fall back to the default.
- `--preset NAME` -- encoder preset. Defaults are codec-dependent:
  `veryfast` for libx264, `p4` (medium) for NVENC. Pass any preset
  string the chosen encoder accepts.
- `--quality N` -- visual-quality knob; lower = higher quality, larger
  file. Mapped to `-crf` for libx264 and `-cq` for NVENC. Default 18
  is perceptually lossless on both.
- `--progress` -- per-frame progress.


## `decode_sync_tags.py` reference

After recording the photodiode signals on a DAQ alongside whatever else
the experiment is sampling, `Source/decode_sync_tags.py` recovers the mapping
between video frame number and DAQ sample index.

The repo deliberately doesn't include code for parsing your specific
DAQ's file format -- load the samples into a numpy array however you
like, then call:

```python
from decode_sync_tags import decode_sync_tags

result = decode_sync_tags(
    samples,                           # (n_channels, n_samples) array
    sample_rate=50_000,                # Hz
    video_path="exp01_tagged.mp4",     # the tagger's output
    calibration_path="cal.json",       # the calibration JSON
    scale="intan_aux",                 # samples are Intan ADC steps
                                       #   ('volts', 'intan_aux',
                                       #   'intan_supply', etc., or a
                                       #   numeric multiplier)
    output_path="exp01_frames.csv",    # CSV table to write
    metadata="2026-04-30 rig A trial 7",
)
# result.frame_table is an (n_frames, 2) int64 array of
#   (frame_number, sample_index) rows.
```

The tagger writes a sidecar `<output_video>.tags.json` next to its
output that records the sync-bit setting and channel-to-bit assignment;
the decoder reads it automatically. Pass `sync_bit_override=True/False`
to force a value (useful if the sidecar is missing or wrong).

The decoder assumes the recording contains exactly one complete
video playback bracketed by "video off" padding on both sides. It
raises `RuntimeError` for fundamental problems:

- No bimodal signal on the sync-bit channel (or any channel in
  `--no-sync-bit` mode). Recording probably has no video at all, the
  channel order doesn't match calibration, or the scale factor
  produced near-constant voltages.
- More than one sync-on segment longer than 0.25 s detected (chunk
  the recording yourself before passing it in).

Softer issues land in `result.warnings_` (and the CSV's `# warning:`
header lines):

- The first decoded frame's cyclic value isn't gray(1) -- the player
  may have skipped a frame at the start, or the leading guard frames
  ate it.
- Decoded frame count differs from the source video's count
  (severity tiers `minor` ≤ 5, `noteworthy` > 5).
- Per-channel threshold drift vs. calibration baselines.
- Individual dropped frames recovered via timing.
- Measured fps disagrees with the declared fps by more than 1%.
- Sub-frame-duration "frames" detected at segment boundaries
  (analog rise/fall settling artifacts) and dropped automatically.

Specific case worth flagging in **--no-sync-bit mode**: if the video's
total frame count is an exact multiple of `2**n_pds` (i.e. the cycle
length), the very last frame Gray-encodes to all zeros and is
indistinguishable from the post-video "off" period. The tagger handles
this by default by appending a single black-content frame so the output
isn't an exact cycle multiple (`--no-pad-for-unambiguous-end` opts
out); the decoder also has a safety-net that detects the case if it
slips through, synthesizes the missing last frame at
`last_real_sample + sample_rate/fps`, and emits a warning suggesting
`--sync-bit` to remove the ambiguity. With `--sync-bit` on (the
default) the issue can't arise -- the sync PD is lit on every video
frame.

Pass `verbose=1` for a one-line summary of decoder decisions
(input shape, sync-bit source, segment bounds, decoded count) printed
to stderr; `verbose=2` adds per-channel thresholds, SNR values,
detected segments, and per-transition unwrap accounting. Useful when a
real-rig recording isn't decoding the way you expect.

The internal bimodal threshold is found per channel via Otsu's method
on the recording itself, with the calibration JSON's
`baseline_dark_v` / `baseline_bright_v` used only as a sanity check.
This makes the decoder unit-agnostic given the right `scale`: NI DAQ
records in volts (`scale="volts"` or `1.0`); Intan auxiliary input
channels record raw ADC steps that convert to volts at
`0.0000374 V/step` (`scale="intan_aux"`). The `SCALE_PRESETS` dict in
`decode_sync_tags.py` lists the available shorthand names. Also be aware that
the Intan aux input ranges only ~0 to 2.45 V -- verify the PD signal
doesn't clip at the top of that range.

The CSV output has a `#`-prefixed header carrying the source video
path, calibration path, sample rate, fps, sync-bit setting, cycle,
per-channel detected thresholds, segment bounds, the `metadata` string
the user passed in, and any warnings. Two data columns:
`frame_number,sample_index`. `frame_number` is 1-indexed; `sample_index`
is into the original `samples` array.


## MATLAB wrapper

`Source/decodeSyncTags.m` calls the Python decoder from MATLAB via
MATLAB's [Python Interface](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html).
`Source/setupMonitorioPython.m` configures `pyenv` to point at the
repo's `venv` (auto-discovered alongside the script) in
`OutOfProcess` mode.

Setup -- once per MATLAB session, BEFORE any other Python calls:

```matlab
addpath('path/to/Monitorio/Source');
setupMonitorioPython();
```

Then call `decodeSyncTags` like the Python function:

```matlab
% NI-DAQmx recording (already in volts):
result = decodeSyncTags(samples, 50000, 'tagged.mp4', 'cal.json');

% Intan recording (raw aux-input ADC steps):
result = decodeSyncTags(samples, 30000, 'tagged.mp4', 'cal.json', ...
    'Scale', 'intan_aux', ...
    'OutputPath', 'frames.csv', ...
    'Metadata', 'rig A trial 7', ...
    'Verbose', 1);

% frameTable is N-by-2 double; columns are 1-indexed frame_number and
% 0-indexed sample_index (matches Python). Add 1 if you want a
% MATLAB-style 1-based sample index.
sampleIndex1Based = result.frameTable(:, 2) + 1;
```

`samples` must be `n_channels`-by-`n_samples` with channels in the
same order as the calibration JSON's photodiode list (= physical AI
pin order). Channel order, sync-bit setting, and per-bit channel
assignment are all read from the tagger's `<video>.tags.json` sidecar
automatically.

If you need to use a venv at a different path:

```matlab
setupMonitorioPython('VenvPath', 'C:\path\to\some\other\venv');
```

`pyenv` cannot be reconfigured after Python has been loaded in a
session, so if you previously imported a different Python from MATLAB,
restart MATLAB before re-running setup.


## Random-playback session driver

`Source/playback/play_random.py` runs a session of randomly-chosen
tagged videos with exponentially-distributed inter-video intervals,
intended to drive the experimental rig while the DAQ records
continuously. A single fullscreen pygame window opens on the chosen
monitor and stays black for the entire session; VLC is told to
render its video output into the pygame window's HWND, so the same
window does double-duty as "black between plays" (pygame) and "video
playback surface" (VLC). One persistent window for the whole
session means no per-play window open/close animations, no title
bar, no chrome -- and VLC handles audio + video sync natively.

Requires VLC installed system-wide; see "Software requirements".

```bash
venv/Scripts/python Source/playback/play_random.py CONFIG.toml
```

Run with no arguments to print usage + a path to the example config.

The config (TOML) names the videos, sets the IVI distribution
(exponential mean truncated to `[min, max]` via rejection sampling,
with a startup sanity-check that errors on `min >= max` and warns
when `mean` falls outside `[min, max]`), picks the target monitor,
and points at the output log. See `Source/playback/example_config.toml`
for a fully-commented example.

Each session writes to its own log file: the config's
`output.log_path` is treated as a base, and the actual filename
inserts a UTC timestamp (`playback_log_20260501T230000.csv`). At
the top of every log is a `#`-prefixed banner with the
session-start UTC timestamp, the config's path and short SHA-256
hash, the script's git commit (with `-dirty` flag if uncommitted
changes are present), and a snapshot of the actual config-file
contents -- so it's always possible to reconstruct exactly what
ran. CSV readers skip the banner via `pd.read_csv(comment='#')`
or equivalent.

Press ESC at any time during playback or an inter-video gap to
abort cleanly. When the session reaches its `n_plays` or
`total_session_seconds` limit naturally, the screen stays black
indefinitely until the operator presses ESC -- so the post-session
view doesn't snap back to whatever Windows was showing underneath
mid-experiment. The log flushes after every play, so an aborted
session loses at most the in-progress play.


## Batch-decoding a whole session

`Source/decode_stream.py` is the natural endpoint of the pipeline:
take a `play_random.py` playback log + a directory of recording files
+ a calibration JSON, and get back one decode per playback. Internally
it pairs each log entry with the recording file(s) whose wall-clock
coverage overlaps the playback's expected window, runs the decoder
on the right slice of samples, and writes a per-playback CSV plus a
session-wide summary CSV.

```bash
venv/Scripts/python Source/decode_stream.py \
    playback_log_20260501T160904.csv \
    /path/to/recordings/ \
    --loader rhd \
    --pd-channels 2,3,4 \
    --calibration cal.json \
    --output-dir decoded/
```

Or as a Python function:

```python
from decode_stream import decode_stream

results = decode_stream(
    playback_log=Path("playback_log_20260501T160904.csv"),
    recording_dir=Path("/path/to/recordings/"),
    loader="rhd",
    pd_channels=[2, 3, 4],            # 0-based indices into the loaded
                                      # channel array; sync first
    calibration_path=Path("cal.json"),
    output_dir=Path("decoded/"),
)
# results is a list of StreamResult: per-playback status, frame
# table, drift, warnings, and the path to the per-play decoded CSV.
```

The wall-clock anchor for each recording file is its filename
timestamp (Intan's `<base>_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.rhd` convention; falls back
to mtime). If the playback log's clock disagrees with the recording
filenames' clock by more than ~1 s, decode_stream warns; if the
disagreement is large enough that no overlapping file is found for
a playback, that row is marked `missing` rather than failing the
whole batch. If a chosen sync segment hits the start or end of the
loaded data (i.e. the actual signal extends into an adjacent file we
didn't initially load), decode_stream automatically extends the file
range and retries.

If the playback driver and the recording controller live on
different host machines whose system clocks aren't NTP-synced,
pass `--clock-offset-s` (or `clock_offset_s=` to the function) with
the offset between them, defined as
`recording_clock_seconds - playback_clock_seconds`. Empirical
recipe: run once with offset 0, look at the `segment_drift_s`
column of the summary CSV; if every row reports about the same
drift, that's the offset to plug in for subsequent runs. After
correction, drift should be tens to hundreds of ms (player startup
lag plus the filename-timestamp-vs-actual-sample-0 lag).

The loader knob is open-ended: `--loader rhd` is the only registered
one today, but adding TDMS / OpenEphys / other formats is one entry
in the `LOADERS` dict in `decode_stream.py` plus a `load_*` function
that returns a `RecordingBundle`-shaped object (samples + sample
rate + channel names + per-file wall-clock boundaries).


## Smoke tests

`Source/calibration/scripts/smoke_test_*.py` exercise individual
calibration stages (baselines, DAQ, display, localize, refine,
rise-time, crosstalk). Useful for development and for diagnosing a
rig where the full `calibrate.py` is misbehaving. They all default to
RSE; modify them if you need a different terminal config.


## Automated test suite

`tests/` holds pytest-based regression tests for the parts of the
codebase that are testable without rig hardware: Gray-code encode/
decode and wrap invariants, parameter resolution priorities, terminal-
config-aware AI channel filtering (with nidaqmx mocked), and
end-to-end aspect-ratio scaling of the tagging pipeline against
synthetic ffmpeg videos.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest                # from repo root; auto-discovers tests/
pytest tests/test_gray.py -v        # one file
pytest -k "aspect_scaling"          # one keyword
```

Tests that need ffmpeg auto-skip if it isn't on `PATH`; the nidaqmx
filter tests skip if the `nidaqmx` package isn't importable.


## Caveats and limitations

- LCDs have slow pixels and may show PWM in their backlight. The
  rise-time step in calibration reports actual transition times; if
  the monitor's response is so slow that the per-frame transition
  isn't complete before the next refresh, the bit pattern is
  unreliable. OLED is recommended for timing-critical work.
- Monitor refresh rate vs. video fps: the decoder copes with
  refresh aliasing (e.g. 60 Hz monitor displaying a 45 fps video,
  where each video frame spans 1 or 2 refreshes) -- it counts video
  frame transitions, not monitor refreshes. But for the cleanest
  recordings, prefer a monitor refresh rate that's an integer
  multiple of the video fps.
- The calibration assumes the PDs don't move between calibration and
  measurement. If the PCB is jostled, re-calibrate.
- Multiplexer crosstalk on NI cards is real but tiny at the
  calibration's default 5 kHz DC sample rate. Higher sample rates
  (>= 50 kHz, e.g. for the rise-time measurement) are run single-
  channel to sidestep the mux entirely.
- The decoder requires the recording to be in volts (or supply
  `scale=` to convert raw ADC steps -- the `SCALE_PRESETS` dict in
  `decode_sync_tags.py` lists named factors for Intan inputs). A
  bare `scale=1.0` on Intan ADC-step data still produces a correct
  decode (Otsu's thresholding is unit-agnostic), but the
  threshold-vs-calibration sanity warnings will be noisy because
  units don't line up.
- For "what was on screen at neural-spike sample S?" lookups, use
  the **original (untagged) video** to read frame content. The
  decoder maps `decoded.frame_number N` directly to the original
  source video's frame N (guard frames are sync-OFF and don't enter
  the segment). Using the tagged video for content lookup also
  works, just with the leading guards offsetting the indices.
