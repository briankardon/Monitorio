"""Manual smoke test for calibration.daq.

Phase 1: enumerate devices, list AI channels, and take a short baseline
         acquisition with no stimulus -- reports the noise floor and
         unconnected-channel behavior.
Phase 2: (optional) acquire for a longer window while the operator
         covers/uncovers photodiodes by hand, to verify that the DAQ
         sees signal variation in response to light.

Usage:
    venv\\Scripts\\python Source\\calibration\\scripts\\smoke_test_daq.py [device_name] [n_channels]

If device_name is omitted, the first detected device is used.
If n_channels is omitted, the script uses as many AI channels as can run
at the default sample rate without exceeding the DAQ's aggregate AI rate
(i.e. floor(aggregate_rate / sample_rate)), capped by the physical
channel count. Always in single-ended (RSE) mode.
